  </div>

  <p>This scholarship is open to anyone who will be in the Denver,
    Colorado area on June 24th, 2016. Recipients will receive a free
    ticket to the conference and all events associated with a regular
    admission ticket. Because we are a community-run event, we are unable
    to provide travel and lodging as part of this initiative at this time,
    but hope to be able to in the future.</p>
  <p>We really want to see you there and we hope this scholarship
    can enable you to contribute to our community.</p>
